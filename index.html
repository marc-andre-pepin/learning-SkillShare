            <h2>Disciples and Detractors</h2>
            <p>Diogenes was captured by pirates while on voyage to Aegina and sold as a slave in Crete to a Corinthian named Xeniades. Being asked his trade, he replied that he knew no trade but that of governing men, 
            and that he wished to be sold to a man who needed a master. Xeniades liked his spirit and hired Diogenes to tutor his children. 
            As tutor to Xeniades's two sons, it is said that he lived in Corinth for the rest of his life, which he devoted to preaching the doctrines of virtuous self-control.
